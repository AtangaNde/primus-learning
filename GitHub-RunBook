GIT AND GITHUB 1
Software Development lifecycle (SDLC)
Develops, Tests, Builds, deploys & monitors applications Applications are the output from Software

Releases:
Releasing an application is taking/deploying it to the client.

In realtime we have multiple Releases.

release1 = version1 = 1000lines of code
echo 'Hello, welcome to Primus Learning'

release2 = version2 = 2000lines of code
echo 'Welcome to Paypal'.

echo "Your convenient payment gateway".

Release3 = version3 = 1000 lines of code
echo "Paypal the best payment gateway"

Rollout --> version1 --> version2 ---> version3
RollBack --> version3 --> version2

The client is not happy with the latest version of the application.
What can be done??? We RollBack

Versioning in Software Development:
Version control systems = VCS:

A) Local system:
Developers coding using thier local system e.g laptop

version1, (1000LINES)

version2,[5000LINES ]

version3 [2000LINES ]

cons:
Single point of failure
lacks collaboration
in-efficient use of resources including time
can't RollBack
Apart of the local system, we also have what is known as the centralize system; With this kind of a system, there is a central system, i.e we create a server, where when developers write their codes, they can commit it to the server and save it there Here, there is a level of some collaboration, but the major problem here is that, we can't rollback and the server can go down (fail at anytime), so this method is also not really secured

B) Centralised: cons:
-can't RollBack.

-The central server can fail.

To that effect, we have what is known as the distributed version control system.

GIT => distributed version control system (DVCs)

Git manages data as snapshot
It takes a picture of what all your file looks like at that and stores them, and we can make a reference of that snapshot.

Benefits of Git
With Git;

Developers can collaborate

Here, we have a distributed version control system

 For each developer, we have to make sure that Git is install
 in their local environment.
 And they can write codes and commit it to the remote server 
 and that remote environment is known as GITHUB
Github is a source code manager (SCM)

Github => SCM

With Git;
